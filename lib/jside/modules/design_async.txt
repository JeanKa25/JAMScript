Ask getAdminProcessor() to return a handle for the call (incoming msg).
If the incoming msg is a REGISTER - we could have two situations: (a) already part of the 
table (registered). Not yet registered - new registration. In either case, return a valid handle.

If the nodeid is undefined or Not found and Not Register, then return undefined. 

if getAdminProcessor() returns undefined -> we do nothing in the messageProcessor().

If NOT undefined from getAdminProcessor() then we do
    we process message -> doAdminProcessing()
