(1) We need to check whether the child(n) commands make sense or not.
    There are too many child(n).child(m) type of statements in the semantic definitions.
    We need to fix this in a proper way. 

(2) The yield point insertion method is putting "jsleep" into the source code.
    This should be changed.

(3) Remove the regex inserted by Ing into the semantic processing functions.
